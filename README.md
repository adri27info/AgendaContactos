## Description

This is a js project based on adding contacts to the agenda. Every time we add a contact to the agenda, we will have the option to delete that contact.

Keep in mind that for the contacts to be saved, we have to use local storage for data persistence to work correctly.

## Technologies

The project has been created with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Installation

To run this project, we need the following steps:

- Disable the option to delete cookies and data from the site when the browser is closed, so that the information is displayed in the application correctly. This option will be found in your browser settings.

- Download the Live Server extension, which is found in the vscode editor

- Once the extension is downloaded, run the extension and everything will work correctly

- If you get an error, try running the application normally using the index.html file
